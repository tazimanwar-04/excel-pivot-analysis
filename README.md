Data Analyst Internship – Task 2  
Excel Pivot Table Analysis using Superstore Dataset

This task focuses on analyzing the Superstore sales dataset using Microsoft Excel. The main objective was to summarize sales and profit data using Pivot Tables, identify patterns, and present meaningful insights in a simple and clear way.

Dataset Used  
Superstore Sales Dataset

Tools Used  
Microsoft Excel was used for the complete analysis. Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, slicers, and conditional formatting were applied to summarize and visualize the data.

Work Done  

First, the dataset was opened in Excel and checked for basic issues such as blanks and formatting problems. The data was converted into an Excel Table so that Pivot Tables would update automatically when filters were applied.

Next, a Pivot Table was created to analyze total sales by product category. This helped identify which category contributes the most to overall sales. Technology was found to be the top-performing category.

Another Pivot Table was created to study sales across regions and customer segments. Conditional formatting was used to highlight high- and low-performing values, making comparison easier.

Profit was then analyzed across different discount levels. A Pivot Table was used to compare profit against discount percentages, and conditional formatting was applied to clearly show profit and loss values. This analysis showed that higher discounts often lead to negative profits.

To improve understanding, a Pivot Chart was created to visually compare category-wise performance. Slicers for Region, Category, and Segment were added so the report could be filtered interactively.

Finally, all Pivot Tables, charts, and slicers were arranged into a single report sheet. This report was exported as a PDF for easy sharing and submission.

Key Learnings  

This task helped me understand how Pivot Tables can be used to summarize large datasets efficiently. I also learned how discounts impact profitability and how visualizations and slicers make data analysis easier to understand.
